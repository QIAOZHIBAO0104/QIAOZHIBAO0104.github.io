For the first project, we were tasked with querying the National Hockey League’s “Franchise” API. ,and the NHL stats API. For this purpose, I created a series of functions that can read in and parse JSON data using package jsonlite, for five different puporse.By using these functions, a user can insert a franchiseId and receive the row for that particular franchise, also the user can use some different modifiers and endpoints to get the data of interest. I wrote some functions to achieve the goal. I think it is a great practice to refine my understand of loops and function writing. I also learned how to access more datasets in R. I have to say this kind of data accessing is amazing.

I joined some data sets with different endpoints by franchiseId. After have a glance on the combined data, I was wondering if we can define some of the variables as factors and to see the associations between some certain variables. My personal interest is game wins,game looses,gametype, activestatus and etc. So I checked this idea by some general statistical function and see a potential connections between the converted factors and selected variables.To get a more direct result, I use ggplot function to make some nice plots.

In this project, data analysis was not the most difficult part for me, writing functions and specifying the franchise of choice by both name and number is. So I think the biggest thing l learned is how to nest other function or loops in a function, it is challenging but interesting, and I found the tools that R offers are unlimited.
