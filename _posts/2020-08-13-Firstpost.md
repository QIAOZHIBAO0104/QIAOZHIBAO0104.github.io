title: data scientists or statisticans?
---
What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
Data scientist should be backed up with both statistics and software engineering skills,this means a data scientist can work in a interdiscipline team to coordinate different tasks.


What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
data scientist pays more attention on the data science process by studying data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. 

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

differences: data scientists and statisticians use different data collection method.Collecting data and information costs data scientist much more time,statisticians use limited methods to get information and usually the amount of data that they collect is not that massive.
data scientists focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model,they usually choose the best accuracy model by selecting machine learning algorithms.Statisticians usually simplify models to adept the collected data,they prefer to use some simple models,like linear regression model;

similarities:They both need a statistical background;Data scientists and statisticians tend to gather information for similar purposes;

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I would more likely to be a data scientist as I am more interested in using machine learning algorithms to select models.Also i would like to explore more software engineering fields.
