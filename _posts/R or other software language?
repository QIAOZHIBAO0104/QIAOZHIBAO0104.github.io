title: R or other software language?
---

Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

I am also a SAS user. Personally, I like R more for the following reasons. First, I can generate and compile my own function depends on different situation in R, it is very flexible when taking R for data analysis. Second, there are a large number of packages open for users and you are allowed to explore your own package. And another point is I enjoy the plot function in R badly. But sometimes with a huge data set R could be slower than SAS, SAS is a better choice with huge data.

I do not think R as a difficult language to learn. Keeping flexibility is kind of important as well as difficulty for R users. I knew R prior to the course, but just with very limited experience as some courses only involved with R application. I had a rough time with different kinds of errors as I did not understand some syntax and rules of R.I tried to get help from some R guide books and it was turned out to be very effective for a first learner. So I would be very appreciated to have a course involves with R very detailed. I am looking forward to learn more about R.
